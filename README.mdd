# COVID-19-detection-

Summary:This initiative creates a system for identifying COVID-19 infection through machine learning models. The dataset comprises attributes that could encompass symptoms, results from diagnostic tests, or image data such as chest X-rays.

Goals:-
*Precisely categorize cases as either COVID-positive or negative.
*Pinpoint essential characteristics that aid in making predictions.

Techniques:-
*Data preparation: Normalizing and sanitizing data for evaluation.
*Feature engineering: Choosing and modifying important features.
*Model training: Training classification models while fine-tuning hyperparameters.
*Assessment: Verifying models using precision and sensitivity measurements.

Essential Elements:-
*Dataset: Attributes signify medical imaging or patient information.
*Algorithms: Neural networks and various classifiers.
*Assessment Measures: Precision, sensitivity, and specificity.
